TERM AND TERMINATION. This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for three (3) years. It renews automatically for successive 1-year terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the then-current term. Either party may terminate for material breach upon 30 days' written notice if the breach remains uncured.

CONFIDENTIALITY. Each party agrees to maintain confidentiality of all proprietary information exchanged under this Agreement. Obligations last for 5 years post-termination.
